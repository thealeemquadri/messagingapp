# Sample-Code
This is the sample code for the application of MLH Prep program.

Here, I have created a secret message sharing app where people can write a message, which will generate a link which the user can send to whom he/she wanted to share that message.
Then that shared link can be acessed and it will show the secret message to the receiver.

# Logic-behind-code
To generate a secret message, we are taking input and converting the every string of it into base code using atob function.
